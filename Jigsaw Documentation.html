                    <!-- Overview and Purpose ================================================== -->
                    <div class="bs-docs-section">
                        <div class="page-header">
                            <h1 id="overview">1. Overview and Purpose</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw is a visual 
analytics system designed to help people browse, explore, analyze, 
understand and make sense of collections of text documents.  Jigsaw 
presents multiple visualizations of the documents and the entities 
within them, with a special focus on showing connections between 
entities (entities that appear together in some document).</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw is designed to 
work best with collections of many documents that are relatively short 
in length.  By many documents, we mean collections that may go up to 
5,000-10,000 documents.  We think that Jigsaw possibly could run well on
 collections approaching 50,000 or 100,000 documents too, given that 
your computer has very fast processors and a great deal of RAM.  The 
documents ideally should be about 1-6 paragraphs in length, that is, 
about a page or two.  What is most important here is the number of named
 entities per document. This number should likely be below about 50-75 
entities for Jigsaw to be most helpful.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw is not designed 
to analyze a small number of extremely large documents like books or 
academic papers.  These types of documents should be broken into smaller
 units such as sections, subsections, or pages, and then each of these 
units becomes its own document.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Because Jigsaw provides 
many different visualizations of the documents and entities, you should 
ideally have a large amount of screen real estate to show the views.  We
 find that the system functions best on a computer with a large display 
such as a 30” monitor or on a computer with multiple monitors.  While 
you can still run the system on a single smaller monitor, you may be 
limited in the number of views you can easily manipulate or you may have
 to do much window swapping via the taskbar or other means.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">We have tried to keep 
this Tutorial relatively concise so that you can easily read and browse 
it, while still communicating the most important information necessary 
to effectively use the system.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">If you prefer 
interactive video assistance over a printed document (and who doesn’t 
these days), you should watch the tutorial videos on the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/ii/jigsaw/tutorial" target="_blank">web page</a>.
 They should be helpful in learning how to use the system.  The “System 
Requirements” video, in particular, provides assistance with getting the
 system set up and running on your machine.</p>

                    <!-- Getting Started ================================================== -->
                    <div class="bs-docs-section">
                        <div class="page-header">
                            <h1 id="getting-started">2. Getting Started with Jigsaw</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p class="text-justify">This section will help you to quickly familiarize yourself with how to run Jigsaw.</p>

                        <h3 id="system-requirements">2.1 System Requirements</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">We have tested Jigsaw on
 Windows 7, 8, and 10 platforms, on Linux, and on a Macintosh running 
MacOS 10.5-10.10.  It should run well on all of these platforms.  You 
can run Jigsaw on a machine with 1 GB of RAM but we don’t recommend it. 
 You should really have at least 2 GB of RAM to run the system.  Having 
more than that is even better.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">You should have Java 
Version 8 installed on your computer in order to run Jigsaw. To check 
what version of Java is being used on your machine, go to a command 
shell/terminal/window and type the command <code>java –version</code>.  
If the second digit in the reported Java version is an ‘8’, then you are
 OK.  We believe that Jigsaw will run OK with version 7 of java, but it 
definitely will not run with version 6 or earlier. As such, we strongly 
recommend you download Java release 8 to use the system, plus this newer
 version of java is more secure in general.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">If you are on a Windows machine and need to update to a newer version of Java, it can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.java.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. This is the same for Macs with OS 10.7 or newer.</p>
                       
                        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                            <h4>Advanced Users</h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">We have configured 
the Jigsaw start-up command to request 1 GB of memory for the Java 
virtual machine.  If you are running on a machine with more RAM, you can
 bump up this number.  To do so, simply edit either the Jigsaw.bat 
(Windows), Jigsaw.command (Mac), or Jigsaw.sh (Linux/UNIX) script file 
and change the two occurrences of 1024 (which provides 1 GB) to 
something like 2048 or 4096.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3 id="initiating-session">2.2 Initiating a Session</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">On a Windows machine, double-click on the <code>Jigsaw.bat</code>
 script file   in the Jigsaw folder to start the system. This is a short
 script file that will start Java and will try to give the system a good
 amount of heap memory. If this script runs successfully, then it will 
bring up the Jigsaw Control Panel, shown below.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">On a Mac, double-click on the <code>Jigsaw.command</code> script file in order to start the system.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">On Linux/UNIX, execute the shell command file <code>Jigsaw.sh</code>.</p>
                        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                            <h4>Note</h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">In Mac OS 10.8 
(Mountain Lion) or newer, you cannot run it by simply double-clicking on
 the Jigsaw.command file because it was downloaded from the internet. In
 this case, you need to right mouse button-click (or control-click) in 
order to bring up a menu and then you choose the “Open” option. Once you
 do that, you will be able to just use a double-click on subsequent 
tries.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3 id="reading">2.3 Reading in a Set of Documents</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw can read in (and 
store) documents from a variety of formats. It can read original 
documents such as text, csv, html, pdf, Word, and Excel files.  We also 
have created a Jigsaw Datafile format using xml that can be read in. 
Additionally, there are a few specific, proprietary document formats 
that Jigsaw can read.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">To import a source 
document that has not been processed at all yet, use the File menu’s 
Import command.  This will bring up the Import dialog box with tabs for 
the different types of documents that can be read in.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The main tab here is 
Files.  It allows you to read in plain text (.txt), MS Word (.doc), PDF 
(.pdf), html (.htm or .html), comma-separated value (.csv), and MS Excel
 (.xls) files.  To read in multiple files at once, use the Browse button
 and select multiple files in the chooser dialog box.  For csv and MS 
Excel files, a special mapping process will begin that allows you to 
specify what each column in the file means (more on that later in this 
document).  We hope to soon add the ability to read in pages and sites 
from web crawls, pages from web searches, and bibliographic style pages.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The files you import can
 be simple ASCII text or they can be Unicode.  Because Jigsaw can now 
read Unicode, text from international (non-English) languages can be 
handled in Jigsaw too.</p>

                        <img src="Jigsaw%20Documentation_files/import_dialog.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Import Dialog">

                        <p class="text-justify">A second tab in the 
Import dialog allows you to import Jigsaw Datafiles.  We have created a 
simple proprietary xml file format for Jigsaw.  If you have some 
specific type of data that you would like to analyze in Jigsaw, one 
option is to first translate it to Jigsaw’s Datafile format.  We have 
included a few sample Jigsaw Datafiles in the distribution such as the 
documents from the 2007 VAST Symposium contest, all the paper abstracts 
from InfoVis and VAST papers, a sample of papers from PubMed about 
breast cancer, and the Bible.  We use the folder named datafiles to 
store Jigsaw Datafiles. More about this is presented in the next section
 and in the Appendix.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">When you import a 
document or a set of documents, you also can choose to perform entity 
identification on the documents if you would like.  This is done via a 
second dialog box that will pop up.  (If you have many files and they 
are relatively large, entity identification can be time-consuming, so be
 patient.) Alternately, entity identification can be performed later in 
the analysis process as well. To learn more about entity identification,
 see <a href="#identifying-and-working-entities">this section</a>.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">When Jigsaw imports a 
set of documents, it builds an analysis database for those documents on 
disk.  This is done so that Jigsaw can scale up to large document 
collections.  Note, however, that the first time a set of documents is 
imported, building this database can be time-consuming, perhaps taking 
quite a few minutes.  Once done, this analysis database is called a 
Jigsaw Project.  Subsequent analysis sessions will be much faster to 
commence though since this Jigsaw project/database simply will be read 
in from disk.  A Jigsaw Project file (.jp) is represented by a file in 
the Projects folder of the system and it encapsulates a set of documents
 that have been read into Jigsaw along with any entity identification 
that has been performed on them.  Jigsaw also uses the concept of a 
Workspace.   Workspaces include all the information of a Project, but 
they also include multiple Views that may have been active during an 
investigation.  Jigsaw Workspaces (.jws) are encapsulated by a file 
stored in the workspaces folder. The File menu in the Jigsaw control 
panel includes commands for opening and saving Projects and Workspaces.</p>

                        <h3 id="displaying">2.4 Displaying Views</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">To begin analysis, you 
likely want to start with a set of views.  Go to the Views menu and 
choose whichever ones you want.  Note that you can create multiple 
instances of any view type.  We highly recommend having at least one 
Document View open all the time. Note that almost all Jigsaw views begin
 empty (the Document Cluster View is an exception).  This is normal.  
You must perform a search query or do some command in a view in order to
 look for entities and/or documents and to begin to populate the views.</p>

                        <h3 id="start">2.5 Start Analysis and Exploration</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">To begin exploration, 
you can enter a search term in the Control Panel.  Jigsaw will look for 
any identified entities containing that text and will display an 
appropriate representation in each of the views present.  This is the 
default Entities search mode which is initially selected. The Documents 
search mode is useful when you want to search for a plain word (e.g., 
dog, car) that is not necessarily an entity.  Jigsaw acts more like a 
simple search engine for this, bringing up the documents that include 
the search string. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">In general, there are three ways to populate and add information to the views.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Issue search queries from the Jigsaw control panel.</li>
                            <li>Right click on an entity or document and
 issue the Show command. This pushes that item out to be displayed in 
all the other views that are listening.</li>
                            <li>Double-click on an entity or document 
which issues an Expand command and shows connected items in that view 
and other listening ones.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 id="saving">2.6 Saving a Session</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">You can save an analysis
 session already underway by saving it as either a Project or a 
Workspace.  These commands are available under the File menu. See the 
next section for additional details about projects and workspaces.</p>

performance issues when running Jigsaw with anti-virus software (e.g. 
McAfee or Norton/Symantec) when the auto-protection feature is enabled. 
This feature scans the Jigsaw database files each time they are 
accessed, resulting in extreme slowness. To improve performance, you 
need to exclude the Jigsaw/projects folder from being scanned during 
execution.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Below are procedures
 for McAfee VirusScan 8.7i that you can use to improve Jigsaw 
performance while still allowing your system to have virus checking 
enabled.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Open McAfee On-Access Scan Properties</li>
                                <li>Click on All Processes and then the Exclusions tab</li>
                                <li>Click the Exclusions button and then the Add button</li>
                                <li>Use the Browse button to locate the Jigsaw/projects folder and click OK</li>
                                <li>Choose OK again</li>
                                <li>Close McAfee VirusScan</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p class="text-justify">Follow similar procedures for other anti-virus tools.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Similar performance 
issues can occur when using the indexing functionality in Windows 
7/8/10. You can exclude the Jigsaw database from indexing using the 
following steps.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Enter the phrase “Indexing Options” in the search box on the Start menu</li>
                                <li>Click the Modify button</li>
                                <li>In the Change selected locations panel at the top, exclude the Jigsaw/projects folder</li>
                                <li>Click the OK button and click the Close button</li>

                        <h3 id="importing-documents">3.1 Importing Documents</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw can import a 
variety of types of text files.  Presently, it can read in ascii or 
comma-separated value (.csv), Unicode text (.txt), Adobe Acrobat (.pdf),
 Microsoft Word (.doc), and HyperText Markup Language (.htm or .html) 
files.  Plain ascii or Unicode text files are the most reliable type of 
file to import, so whenever possible we recommend that you use text 
files or transform your documents into text files if possible.  Jigsaw 
also does a reasonable job importing “simple” Acrobat and Word files 
made up primarily of plain text.  However, if an Acrobat or Word file 
has complex formatting, images, etc., then the import process is much 
less reliable.  Jigsaw can only read old style Word files (.doc), not 
new .docx files.  Also, beware of Acrobat files with security or 
password protection.  When possible, we recommend transforming Acrobat 
or Word files to plain text for more reliable import.  We have scripts 
and tools that can automate this transformation for large numbers of 
files.  Ask us about this if you are in that situation.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">For html files, Jigsaw 
attempts to discard tags and only read in the actual text content, a 
process which is not perfect.  In general, the process of importing html
 documents in Jigsaw still needs to be improved so do that with caution.</p>
                        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                            <h4>Note</h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw views source 
documents as all textual content.  In general, any text within the file 
is viewed as the body of the document.  There are two exceptions to 
this, however.  If Jigsaw finds the string <code>Date:</code> or <code>Source:</code>
 followed by some other text on a line within the top five lines of a 
file, then it interprets that as a special meta-data line and it uses 
the trailing string as the special <code>&lt;DocDate&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;DocSource&gt;</code> fields for the document, respectively</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="text-justify">To read in multiple 
files at once, simply select multiple files in the File Chooser dialog 
box using the shift- or control- mouse selection operation for your 
particular operating system.</p>

                        <h4>Importing MS Excel and CSV Files</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw also can import 
Microsoft Excel files saved as .xls or .csv files.  We strongly 
recommend using .csv files whenever possible as this is much more 
reliable than reading the formatted Excel files. Also, it’s really 
simple to generate .csv files from your .xls or .xlsx files.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Because the primary unit
 of analysis in Jigsaw is a document, you inevitably may wonder how this
 is handled with these types of files. In general, Jigsaw considers each
 row of a sheet as a separate document.  The columns in a spreadsheet 
can specify attributes such as the ID, date, or body text of the 
document (row), or they can be a type of entity.  It is your 
responsibility to set up the mapping from columns to the relevant 
attributes.  When you initially import a spreadsheet file or files, you 
will be presented with a dialog box that allows you to either define the
 mapping or load a pre-existing mapping.  You should use the pull-down 
menu in the right-hand column below and choose “New” to create a new 
mapping or choose one of the existing mappings already there.</p>
                        
                        <img src="Jigsaw%20Documentation_files/excel_file_importer.png" alt="Excel File Importer" class="img-responsive">
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">When defining a mapping,
 you will see a dialog box like the one below.  It allows you to define 
the attribute specified in each column by selecting the pull-down menu 
above that column.  The menu contains items for the Document ID, date, 
text, and for common entity types such as person, place, and 
organization. This menu also allows you to create a new type of entity 
to be specified in a column. At the top of the dialog box, you can 
specify the row in which the actual data begins, thus ignoring some 
header rows.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">Some important points about spreadsheet import:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Jigsaw can only read old style Excel 
files (.xls), not the newer (.xlsx) files. In either case, we recommend 
using .csv files instead.</li>
                            <li>When importing Excel (xls) documents, 
make sure none of the cell contents are specified by formulae.  The 
Jigsaw import process will not work in that case.  To fix this, choose 
all the cells from the sheet, make a copy, and then paste the cells as 
values.  The software that we use to read Excel sheets needs to have 
simple values, not the formulae that are sometimes stored in Excel 
files.  Of course, this isn’t a problem if you use .csv files.</li>
                            <li>If you create a new entity type in a 
column, that entity type’s name can contain only letters and numbers, 
and it must start with a letter.  No other characters are allowed.</li>
                            <li>If some of your cells are empty, then 
the results may be unpredictable.  Most of the time we believe that they
 simply will be skipped and it will work “correctly”, but to make sure 
of success, try to have contents for all cells.</li>
                            <li>If possible, try to specify the Document
 ID and the Document text attributes.  Even if you choose some simple 
text column to serve as the Document text, this will be helpful.  You 
might even make a new column in your spreadsheet that is the union of a 
variety of other columns.</li>
                            <li>If Jigsaw finds duplicated Document IDs in a sheet being read, the first one will be used, following ones will be skipped.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Jigsaw Datafiles</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">We have created a 
proprietary file format for storing collections of documents that uses 
xml.  In addition to the text contents of a document, this format can 
contain meta-information about the document such as an ID and a date, 
and it can hold a list of identified entities for each document.  We 
call these proprietary files Jigsaw Datafiles (.jig).  By convention, we
 store these in the datafiles folder of the distribution.  We have 
included a number of samples there for you to examine.</p>
                        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                            <h4>Important</h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">Make sure to choose the second tab in the Import dialog box to read in Jigsaw Datafiles.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="text-justify">If you have your own 
data perhaps in some xml format, in a database, or in another format, 
it’s not too difficult for you to translate this into Jigsaw’s Datafile 
format. Examine the Appendix of this tutorial for more information about
 that and for instructions on how to work with your own data.  Trust us 
-- It’s really not too bad.  We have done this to convert other xml 
files into Jigsaw’s format and to scrape web pages and make Jigsaw 
Datafiles from them.  Remember that this is xml, however, so you cannot 
have characters such as &amp;, %, &lt;, or &gt; in your text.  The 
Appendix also has more information about this.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The first line of a 
Jigsaw Datafile can be a filetype specification (Unicode UTF-8, for 
example). Jigsaw will read this specification and interpret the file 
correctly.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Note that if you create 
your own Jigsaw Datafile and you try to import it and the process fails 
or hangs, then you likely have a syntax error in the file such as an 
illegal character, a missing bracket, a mismatched open/close tag, etc. 
 View the small import indicator dialog that is shown and it should give
 you a clue as to where the syntax error is.  For example, if it hangs 
while importing the 17th document, then there is likely a syntax error 
in it or the one after it in your file.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">As another option, if 
you have your own specific data file format and you are not sure how to 
put this into Jigsaw, please get in touch with us and we can possibly 
write an importer for that file format or a translator from that into 
Jigsaw’s Datafile format.</p>
                        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                            <h4>Note</h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">If you have imported
 documents from text files, Word files, spreadsheets, etc., and you 
would like to see them in Jigsaw Datafile format, the File menu also has
 an Export command for writing out the current project as a Jigsaw 
Datafile.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Jigsaw Control Panel Information</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">When Jigsaw has 
successfully imported a set of documents, it shows information about the
 documents in the Control Panel window.  It will show the number of 
documents that have been read in successfully, and the different types 
of entities with a count of how many unique values each entity has.  
Jigsaw assigns a unique color to each entity type that is shown across 
all the different views in the system.</p>

                        <h3 id="jigsaw-projects">3.2 Jigsaw Projects and Workspaces</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">When a set of documents 
have been successfully read in and entity identification potentially 
performed, this set of information is called a Jigsaw Project.  A Jigsaw
 Project file (.jp) is represented by a file in the projects folder of 
the system and it encapsulates a set of documents that have been read 
into Jigsaw along with any entity identification that has been performed
 on them.  You can save projects and then reopen them on subsequent runs
 of the Jigsaw system.  Simply use the Save Project/Save Project As and 
Open Project commands from the File menu in the Jigsaw Control Panel.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">As with any prototype 
system, we recommend that you save your project manually to be safe.  
Note that once a project has been saved, you only need to re-save it if 
you modify the entities within the documents.  Also, for reasons that 
are too complex to be explained here, the Save As command will take a 
longer time to execute than the Save command.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">When Jigsaw imports a 
set of documents, it builds an analysis database for those documents on 
disk.  This is done so that Jigsaw can scale up to larger document 
collections.  Note, however, that the first time a set of documents is 
imported, building this database can be time-consuming, perhaps taking 
quite a few minutes.  Subsequent analysis sessions will be much faster 
to commence though since this Jigsaw project/database simply will be 
read in from disk.  These databases are stored in a folder named DBs 
under the projects folder.  Many files may be stored there and they may 
use a significant amount of disk space.  That is normal.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">In addition to a 
collection of analyzed documents, you can save the active set of Jigsaw 
views as well.  This combined collection of documents and views is 
called a Workspace in Jigsaw (.jws).  Just as done for Projects, the 
File menu in the Jigsaw Control Panel contains Save Workspace and Open 
Workspace commands for manipulating Workspaces.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify"><b>NOTE:</b> In Release 0.54, the Workspaces capability has been disabled due to a bug. We hope to have it fixed soon.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Jigsaw Control Panel
 contains an Entities menu that includes operations for the different 
entity processes described below.  Also, when new documents are 
imported, Jigsaw will prompt the user about performing entity 
identification.</p>

                        <h3 id="entity-identification">4.1 Entity Identification</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">When importing text 
files or spreadsheets, you can choose to have the system automatically 
identify entities.  Presently, Jigsaw provides three main mechanisms to 
identify entities in documents.  First, it includes third party software
 libraries to do automated (statistical) entity identification.  Second,
 it includes the capability to do some basic pattern matching of text to
 identify entity types such as dates, phone numbers, zip codes, email 
addresses, URLs, and IP addresses.  Third, it allows you to provide an 
entity type (name) and a list of the values of that entity type.  Below 
we describe each of these in a little more detail.</p>
                        
                        <img src="Jigsaw%20Documentation_files/entity_identification_dialog.png" alt="Entity Identification Dialog" class="img-responsive">
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">For automated entity identification, Jigsaw can apply one of three possible packages. <a href="http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/" target="_blank">Lingpipe</a>, <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/" target="_blank">GATE</a>, and the Univ. of Illinois entity recognition system <a href="http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/%7Ecogcomp/asoftware.php?skey=FLBJNE" target="_blank">LBJ</a>
 are included with the distribution, so the entity identification 
process will be done local to your computer in these cases.  All the 
packages have strengths and weaknesses so we recommend you try each to 
see which will work best for your documents.  We generally use the 
Illinois NER system and have found it to be quite good in general.  Do 
note, however, that it often seems to crash when trying to read pdf, 
Word, or html files.  The GATE system works quite well too, so you may 
want to give it a try as well.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw also contains 
functionality that can help you identify particular types of strings 
such as dates, phone numbers, zip codes, email addresses, URLs, and IP 
addresses in documents’ text.  This code does some basic regular 
expression matching so it is not perfect.  For example, a 5-digit number
 will be identified as a zip code; we do not validate this with all 
actual zip codes in the United States.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Finally, Jigsaw allows 
you to create a new entity type and specify all of the valid strings 
that are the instances of that entity.  For instance, you could create a
 new entity type “Car” and specify a set of possible values such as 
“Ford”, “Chevrolet”, “Honda”, “Hyundai”, etc.  To do this, you need to 
create a text file (.txt) that has each different possible entity value 
on a different line of the file.  (Note that an entity value needs not 
be just one word; it can have multiple words.)  Jigsaw also allows you 
to specify limited types of regular expressions through this entity 
definition file as well.  To designate that a line of the file is a 
regular expression, the line must begin with the three characters 
“&gt;&gt;&gt;”.  After that, you simply put the letters and numbers that
 you want along with special pattern characters:  &amp;-denotes a 
letter, #-denotes a number, $-denotes either a letter or number, 
+-denotes one or more occurrences of the previous symbol, *-denotes zero
 or more occurrences of the previous symbol.  Thus, the string 
“&amp;red#*” tells Jigsaw to find any word starting with a letter, 
followed by “red” and then followed by zero or more numbers and consider
 it a valid entity value.  The string “abc&amp;&amp;&amp;” tells Jigsaw 
to find any word beginning with “abc” followed by three letters as a 
valid entity value.  An entity definition file can have a mixture of 
normal (non-regular expression) and regular expression lines throughout.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">To then add this new 
entity type to Jigsaw, you use the bottom region of the entity 
identification dialog.  Simply enter the entity type name to the left 
and then browse for the text file containing the list of entity values. 
 Note that entity type names (such as “Car” in the example above) are 
case-sensitive, can only contain letters and numbers, and must start 
with a letter. In using this third type of identification you can make 
the matching be either case-sensitive or not.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Entities menu in the
 Control Panel provides a command for doing additional, subsequent 
entity identification as well.  (Note: There is a bug in Jigsaw and 
sometimes this command does not function properly.) Entity 
identification can be run at any time in an investigation, not just when
 documents are initially imported.  If you have any views open, however,
 they will be closed at that point because the data they show may 
subsequently be incorrect.</p>

                        <h3 id="correcting">4.2 Correcting Erroneous Entity Identification</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">The process of automated
 entity identification is not perfect.  Many false positives 
(identifying entities that really are not entities) and negatives 
(completely missing some valid entities) can occur especially in 
documents with many spelling errors from processes like OCR.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw provides the 
ability to fix incorrect entity identification.  In the Document View, 
you can right-click on an entity and a menu will give you options to 
remove the entity or change its type.  Furthermore, you can 
mouse-click-drag over words in a document to select them, then 
right-click on the selected word(s) and you will get a menu that allows 
you to add the word(s) as an entity.  You can choose one of the existing
 entity types or you can create a new entity type.  The identification 
also can only be relevant to that one particular document or it can 
apply to all documents in the collection.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The List View also 
includes a right-click-menu command Delete that allows you to correct 
erroneous entity identification and remove an entity or entities.  You 
can select multiple entities with shift- or control-click in order to 
remove multiple entities at one time.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">New entity types (names)
 are case-sensitive and cannot contain blank characters or other special
 characters.  The entity type can only include letters and numbers, and 
they must begin with a letter.</p>

                        <h3 id="manipulating">4.3 Manipulating entities</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Entities menu in the Jigsaw Control Panel provides some other operations particularly useful for managing entities.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Clean Up Entities 
command goes through all documents in the collection and identifies 
“missing” entities.  For example, if “Mary Wilson” has been identified 
as a Person entity in one document but not in some other document, by 
issuing this command it will be added as a Person entity in the second 
document.  Essentially, this command makes sure that any entity 
identified in some document is consistently identified throughout the 
entire document collection. Be aware that this function also may add 
more “noise”; if an entity was incorrectly identified in one document, 
it will be added to all other documents in which it occurs.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Remove Singles 
command simply removes any entities in the entire document collection 
that occur only one time.  This command essentially allows analysts to 
remove potential “noise” entities and focus on those that more commonly 
occur.  Note that this command can only be issued before any views have 
been created.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Because of how they 
are implemented, both the Clean Up Entities and Remove Singles commands 
will run extremely slowly on larger document collections. We hope to fix
 this in a subsequent version of the system.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Entities menu also 
includes a Manage Entities command that will bring up the entity browser
 for viewing entity attributes and for manipulating entity aliases (see 
below section).  So, for instance, you could bring up a person entity 
and you could create a phone number attribute and enter the person’s 
phone number as that attribute’s value. Presently, Jigsaw does not 
incorporate entity attributes into the system extensively, but you can 
specify them manually through the entity browser.</p>

                        <h3 id="entity-aliasing">4.4 Entity aliasing</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw also allows you 
to create aliases for entities.  Suppose that a person’s name is spelled
 three different ways in a document collection, but you know that they 
are all the same person.  Alternately, suppose that a person is using an
 alias, that is, there is another name that they go by.  Jigsaw allows 
entities to be aliased in order to handle either of these situations. 
Entity aliases can either be defined interactively through the views or 
by specifying an entity alias file that is read in at the start of an 
investigation.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">In order to 
interactively create an alias, select two or more entities in the List 
View or the Graph View (remember to use control-click to accumulate 
selections), and then right-click to invoke a menu that will have the 
Make Aliases command in it.  Choose that, and the system will ask which 
of the entity names should be the main one to use for this alias.  Once 
you have done that, all the other subordinate entities will be removed 
from views and only this main entity name will be used.  That “winning” 
entity name will be drawn in an <em>italic font</em> to indicate that it
 has aliases.  Upon moving the mouse cursor over such an entity, a 
pop-up view will arise showing the other aliases.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">In the List View, if 
there are too many entities, this pop-up behavior can be annoying.  You 
can turn this off via a menu command at the top.  If you do, the aliases
 for an entity will only pop up if the F1 key is held down as you mouse 
over the names.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">To specify entity 
aliases via a file, use the Add Aliases command from the Entities menu 
in the Jigsaw control panel. We recommend you do this right after you 
have imported your documents and run the initial entity identification. 
When you issue the Add Aliases command, the dialog box shown below will 
appear.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">For each different 
entity type that will have aliases, you need to create a text/csv or a 
JSON file that has a set of alias specifications in it. Each line of the
 file will hold a different alias. On that line, use commas to separate 
the different strings to be aliases. The first alias on the line will be
 the one shown throughout Jigsaw as the “winner” in an <em>italics font</em>.  For example, below are three valid alias definition lines in a txt or csv file:</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">Once you have imported a
 document collection, you are ready to explore, investigate, and analyze
 the documents and their entities.  In all likelihood, you want to 
create a number of different views to show the documents and entities.  
Remember that you can have any number of views of any of the existing 
view types present.</p>

                        <h3 id="general-tips">5.1 General Tips</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Views show entity-document and 
entity-entity connections.  A document and an entity are connected if 
the entity appears in the document. Two entities are considered to be 
connected if they appear in at least one document together.  As the 
number of documents in which they appear together increases, so does the
 quantitative connection strength.</li>
                            <li>Any view can be cloned (copied) at any time using the Edit menu’s Clone command.</li>
                            <li>The Edit menu’s Clear command in a View is useful if the view gets too “noisy” and you just want to blank it out again.</li>
                            <li>A single mouse click on an item 
(document or entity) selects that item.  All the other visible items 
then update their appearance to show how they related to that selected 
item.  A double-click on an item expands the item – typically this shows
 connected items to it.  User mouse actions such as selections and 
expansions also are transmitted to other active views which update their
 representation appropriately too.</li>
                            <li>You can turn off/on event listening in 
each view by clicking on the little satellite dish in the upper right.  
Turning off listening essentially freezes the view, that is, user 
actions such as clicks and double-clicks in other views will not affect 
this view.  This capability is very useful to lock a view at an 
interesting state.  Note that frozen views also are not affected by the 
Clear All Views command in the Views menu.</li>
                            <li>To push an item (entity or document) out
 to all other open and listening (non-frozen) views, right-click on the 
item and use the Show command.  Similarly, doing a search on a string 
through the Control Panel will push out all entities containing that 
string to all the active (listening) views.</li>
                            <li>To examine a document or the set of 
documents containing an entity in an empty new Document View, 
right-click on the item and use the Show in new Document View command.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 id="search-tips">5.2 Search Tips</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">There are two 
search/query modes available through the two checkboxes under the query 
entry region in the Jigsaw Control Panel window.  In Entities mode, 
Jigsaw will seek out documents containing the words from the query 
string in already identified entities within those documents.  That is, 
only documents (and entities) will be retrieved that have the search 
terms in existing entities in those documents.  This is the default 
mode.  In Documents mode, which is accessed by selecting the Documents 
checkbox, Jigsaw simply retrieves documents that contain words from the 
search query somewhere in the document text.</p>
                        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                            <h4>Note</h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">Different kinds of 
Boolean searches can be performed in Jigsaw. (For those in the know, we 
use Lucene to perform search.) When your search query has multiple words
 such as</p>
                            <div class="highlight">John Mary Bill</div>
                            <p class="text-justify">you will be doing an
 “or”-based search, that is, finding documents that mention one or more 
of those words.  You can also do other Boolean operations such as</p>
                            <div class="highlight">“john smith” AND mary</div>
                            <p class="text-justify">which searches for 
documents having both “john smith” and “mary” in them.  For more about 
the different types of searches that can be performed, see <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html" target="_blank">Query Parser Syntax</a>.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3 id="view-specific">5.3 View-specific Use Tips</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">The sections below 
briefly describe some of the utility, commands, and capabilities of the 
different views in Jigsaw.  For more specific help and use tips, please 
see the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/ii/jigsaw/tutorial" target="_blank">video tutorial</a> for each view.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Note that each view has 
its own menus at the top that provide useful operations for that view.  
For example, some of the views have filtering operations that allow you 
to limit what is shown.  Others have an Export command to output 
information from the view to a text file. All views have Change Title, 
Clear, and Clone operations and the ability to bookmark the view.</p>

                        <h4>Document View</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Document View is the
 core view in Jigsaw for reading document contents. The list on the 
lower left holds a set of documents that have been loaded into this 
view.  Documents are placed there in response to control panel search 
queries, by Show commands from other views, or by Expand commands issued
 in other views. Additionally, the Add All button in the lower left will
 bring all documents in the collection into the view.  Be careful about 
using this command with extremely large document collections.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Click on any document 
name to select it and show its text in the focus area to the right. The 
number by the document ID is how often a document has been viewed.  All 
of the documents listed in this view that have the little clouds to the 
left selected (darkened) are participating in the word cloud at the top,
 which shows the key words used throughout that set of documents. You 
can click on the clouds to toggle whether or not the corresponding 
document participates in the word cloud.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">In the region above the 
actual document text is the “document summary,” the one sentence from 
the document that Jigsaw has selected to most exemplify what the 
document is about.  This can be useful for fast triage of multiple long 
documents.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Within the document 
focus region, the body text for the document is shown at the top, and 
below it are listed any affiliated entities that do not occur in the 
document text.  Entities are colored in a pastel shade of their default 
color.  Clicking on an entity selects it.  You can perform manual entity
 identification by making a mouse drag selection of a word or words 
which selects them, then do a right mouse button-click on the selection 
to get a menu that allows you to add this as a new entity.  Similarly, 
you can right-click on an already existing entity to access commands for
 removing it as an entity or changing its entity type.</p>
                        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                            <h4>Note</h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">As documents get 
larger and larger, they tend to load much more slowly in the Document 
View. The Document View has a menu command at the top for printing out 
to a file all of the loaded documents within it.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>List View</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">We find the List View to
 be the most powerful and useful view in Jigsaw.  It provides very easy 
browsing, selection, filtering, and exploration of all the entities and 
documents in the collection being analyzed.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The view begins showing 
two columns, but you can add/remove lists (columns) via commands from 
the Lists menu in the view so that you can fill out a wide view with as 
many lists as you want.  The view will scroll horizontally if there is 
not enough room.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Each column holds 
entities of a particular type – the type can be changed through the menu
 at the top of each list.  The same entity type can be put into 
different columns too. You add entities to lists by doing search queries
 or issuing Show operations from other views.  Additionally, the Add All
 button above a list brings all the entities of that type from the 
entire document collection into a list.  This is often useful early in 
analysis to examine all the different entities that have been 
identified.  Be careful with very large document collections with many, 
many entities of a particular type, however.  That may generate a very 
long scrolling list.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The bar to an entity’s 
left is a frequency counter across the entire document collection.  By 
moving the mouse pointer over this small bar you can find the exact 
number of documents in the collection in which that entity appears.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The buttons and menus 
above a column control how that particular list appears.  The first 
three buttons sort the list in different ways: 1) alphabetically, 2) by 
frequency of appearance in the entire collection, or 3) by connection 
strength to the selected item(s).  Other buttons control the alignment 
of entities and allow you to clear a list.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Clicking on an entity 
selects it; shift-click and control-click allow multiple entities to be 
selected.  Selected entities are drawn in yellow.  Entities connected to
 the selected entities are drawn in orange with darker shades indicating
 stronger connections.  Unconnected entities are drawn with a white 
background.  When multiple entities are selected, two buttons in the 
upper right control whether entity connections are shown via or’ing the 
selected entities or and’ing the selected entities.  For example, in and
 mode, connected entities (those shown in orange) must co-occur in some 
document(s) with all the selected entities.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">A right-mouse-button 
click on a selected entity or entities provides a menu with a number of 
useful operations including Show, Hide, Expand, and Delete.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The List View has a menu
 command at the top for printing out to a file all of the currently 
visible entities in the lists.  If you want just the connected entities,
 sort the list by connection strength and then just remember the last 
connected entity and edit the output file manually.  (This is currently 
broken in the distribution.)</p>

                        <h4>Graph View</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Graph View provides a
 node-link graph representation of the document and entity collection. 
To have documents or entities appear in this view initially, you must 
search for them in the Control Panel or issue Show commands from other 
views. Documents are represented by white rectangles and entities are 
represented by colored (by type) circles. A line from an entity to a 
document means that the entity appears in that document.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">A single click selects 
an item and double click expands/compresses it.  You can click and drag 
on the background to do a rectangular rubber-band selection of multiple 
items at once.  Shift-drag-click does a circular rubber-band instead.  
Expanding an entity (double-click) shows all the documents in which it 
resides, and expanding a document shows all the entities within it. You 
can manually move documents and entities by clicking and dragging them. 
 The plus sign indicates that not all connections (entity-document) are 
presently shown and you can expand it to see more.  Right-click gives a 
menu of helpful operations. The Flow Select command is useful for 
broadening the active selection out by one jump.  You can then issue a 
subsequent menu command such as Expand, Remove or Invert Selection and 
it applies to all of the selected items.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Circular Layout 
button/command at the top left is very useful.  It changes the layout of
 documents so that all are equally spaced around a virtual circle in the
 window.  Entities appearing in only one document are drawn near it, but
 outside the circle.  Entities appearing within multiple documents shown
 in the view are drawn inside the circle.  As the number of document 
connections increase, the entity is drawn  closer and closer to the 
center.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The cursor button near 
the upper right toggles between Selection mode (default to start) and 
Zoom/Pan mode.  In Zoom/Pan mode, clicking down with the left mouse 
button and dragging does a pan operation.  Clicking down with the right 
mouse button and dragging does zoom out (mouse movements up) and zoom in
 (mouse movements down).</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The default background 
color for the Graph View is black unlike almost all other Jigsaw views. 
 It can be changed to white through a command in the Options menu at the
 top.  This menu contains other commands for customizing how the graph 
is drawn.</p>

                        <h4>Calendar View</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">This view shows 
documents and entities in the context of dates relevant to them, that 
is, in the context of the formal Document Date or any dates mentioned 
within a document.  The main portion of the view shows a calendar.  
Within that region, small gray diamonds represent documents and colored 
diamonds represent entities.  The diamonds are drawn on the dates 
relevant to the entity/document that they represent, ie, the dates from 
the documents in which they appear. When an entity is found using search
 or the Show command, it is added to the upper left region of the view, 
but it is not initially placed in the calendar region.  By clicking on 
the entity name in the upper left region, you can toggle whether it 
should appear in the calendar region of the view.  Initially, the 
default entity type color is used for each entity, but by clicking on 
the small color square, you can change this color for a particular 
entity (perhaps to make it stand out). By clicking on an entity type 
name in this area, you toggle whether all of the entities of that type 
below are shown or not.  When you move the mouse pointer over a document
 diamond, the entities in that document are shown in the lower left.  
The Show All, Clear All, and Filter menus at the top are useful to 
control which types of entities are shown.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The controls in the 
upper left corner of the view are very important.  You can have entities
 and documents appear at the actual DocDate of a document, or you can 
also have entities and documents appear on all of the different dates 
mentioned within a document, or you can have both.  You also can control
 the range of years shown in the view.  The two modes within the 
Granularity menu control whether individual days are shown in the 
calendar (larger, likely requires scrolling) or only months are shown 
(more compact).</p>


                        <h4>Document Cluster View</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">This view provides a 
quick overview of the entire document collection by representing each 
document in the collection as a small rectangle icon in the window. 
Initially, the documents start in one big pile, but they can be manually
 moved or clustered by operations in the view. When a search query from 
the Control Panel is done, the search term will be added to the upper 
left region of this view.  Clicking on that term will then color all the
 documents that contain that particular entity.  Clicking on Group by 
Filters button then will segregate the documents into clusters by color.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">In addition, if you have
 performed a document clustering computation (through the Tools menu in 
the Jigsaw Control Panel), the documents can be laid out in clusters 
determined by either the full text of the documents or the entities 
within documents.  Use the pop-up combo chooser to select which 
clustering you want to display.  Through the Tools menu in the Jigsaw 
Control Panel is a command to create and name new clusterings (varying 
in number of clusters and whether they are text- or entity-based).  This
 area also contains a slider that allows you to control the words 
selected to describe what each cluster is about.  These terms can range 
from being very frequent, common ones (slider to the left) or very 
unique words only to that cluster (slider to the right).  You can right 
click on any of the descriptive words for a cluster which will bring up a
 menu that will allow you to replace the word and do other commands.</p>
                        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                            <h4>Note</h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">By clicking on the 
header for a cluster, you can select all the documents within that 
cluster and perform an operation on all or simply move all together.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="text-justify">You can also highlight 
(in a surrounding yellow glow) all the documents that you have read so 
far (been brought to the front in some Document View) by clicking on the
 Highlight Viewed Documents button in the upper left.  This is useful 
for keeping track of what you have examined so far in an investigation.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The bottom-left region 
shows a Windows Explorer style view of the hierarchical clustering of 
documents.  You can click on documents in the list to and their 
corresponding icon will be selected.  Clicking the plus-sign for a 
particular document also shows all the entities in it.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Documents can be 
manually moved and grouped by clicking and dragging as well.  Clicking 
in the background and dragging performs a rubber-band selection so that 
multiple documents can be chosen and moved together. A regular 
click-drag does a rectangular selection and a shift-click-drag does an 
oval/circular selection.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Document Cluster 
View has a menu command at the top for printing out to a file all of the
 different clusters and which documents are inside each cluster 
(currently broken in the distribution).</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The default background 
color for the Document Cluster View is black unlike almost all other 
Jigsaw views. It can be changed to white through a command in the 
Options menu at the top.</p>

                        <h4>WordTree View</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">This view is a version 
of the WordTree visualization introduced by IBM through the Many Eyes 
visualization site and their 2008 IEEE InfoVis paper.  Here, the 
WordTree applies to all documents in the collection. This view helps you
 understand the context of different words in the collection.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">When you enter a term in
 the upper text entry region, the system will show all the trailing 
words/context that follow it in some document.  You can constrain the 
view to compress all the strings to fit in the window or you can allow 
it to show more via scrolling. By right clicking on a string in the 
view, you can bring up a menu that allows you to add those documents 
containing the string to a Document View window.</p>

                        <h4>Document Grid View</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">This view is useful for 
seeing a sorted and shaded list of all the documents in the collection 
where the order and shading can communicate different metrics about the 
documents. The view begins empty but documents can be added via Show 
operations in other views, search queries, or the Add All button in this
 view. Each document is represented as a small rectangle within the 
view.  The documents are sorted from the top-left to the bottom-right by
 row.  You can apply different metrics to control this order and the 
shading of each document’s rectangle.  Mousing over a document rectangle
 shows its Document ID and the value for the metric used to control 
sorted order. Presently, only a number of different metrics are 
available: the size of a document, the number of entities in a document,
 the document date, the document’s sentiment, and the documents’ 
similarity to a selected document.  By selecting the checkbox in the 
upper left, you can make the documents organized by cluster (if that has
 been computed) and then ordered and sorted appropriately within those 
clusters.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Document Grid View 
has a menu command at the top for printing out to a file all of the 
different documents in the view in the order in which they appear and 
with a metric for each.</p>

                        <h4>Circular Graph View</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">This view is similar to 
the Graph View, but no documents are presented.  Instead, entities that 
are “connected” (co-occur in some document) are shown with lines 
connecting them.  The view uses a simple graph layout algorithm: all 
entities are plotted on the circumference of a circle with entities of 
the same types grouped together.  You must select an entity or entities 
by clicking on them to see the connecting lines.  Use control-click to 
select multiple items at a time.</p>

                        <h4>Scatterplot View</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">This view is useful for 
seeing entity-entity connection (co-occurrence) in documents within the 
collection. You can place different entity types on the x and y axes 
through the menus at the top-left and bottom-right.  Particular entities
 then are added along the axes through search queries or Show commands 
from other views. A diamond in the center region then represents a 
document that contains the horizontal-vertical combination of the two 
corresponding entities.  By double-clicking on an entity, you expand it 
and its connected entities are added to the axes as well. Each axis has 
zooming sliders to narrow down the viewed region(s) of entities.</p>

                        <h4>Timeline View</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">This view shows 
horizontal timelines onto which documents are placed. A tower of small 
colored bars (entities) represents a document.  Each tower (document) is
 drawn at a position along a timeline corresponding to its document 
date. You can use the mouse to focus on a particular segment of a 
timeline.  Simply perform a drag selection of a horizontal subregion of a
 timeline.  That smaller temporal selected region then will be drawn in a
 new timeline above.  Any documents falling within the selected region 
will be shown in this new timeline as well.</p>

                        <h3 id="automated">5.4 Automated Computational Analysis</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw provides a number
 of different automated computational analyses that can help you explore
 the document collection.  It provides four important capabilities: 
document summarization, document similarity, document clustering, and 
sentiment analysis.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">To employ these 
analyses, you must first instruct Jigsaw to calculate them.  To do this,
 choose the appropriate command(s) from the Tools menu in the Jigsaw 
control panel. If you want to employ these analyses, we strongly 
recommend that you calculate them immediately after importing your 
documents and performing entity identification.  The “Compute All” 
command from the Tools menu will perform all of these analyses and when 
it completes, they will all be available for use.  By default it uses 
clusters of size 20.  Alternately, you can compute each of the analysis 
measures by itself.  When you do this for the document clustering, for 
example, you are presented with more control options, ie, how many 
clusters and whether the clustering is text- or entity-based.  (Note 
that if not enough documents or entities are present, Jigsaw may create a
 smaller number of clusters than what was requested.) Whenever you 
subsequently save your analysis in a Jigsaw Project, all the analyses 
will be there for the next time you invoke Jigsaw.  Note that when you 
perform the computational analyses, Jigsaw blocks and you cannot perform
 any other operations.  The analyses can take a significant amount of 
time too.  For a document collection of five thousand documents or for 
larger documents, the analyses may take hours.  In a situation like 
this, we recommend that you start the analyses and then do something 
else in the interim, maybe even run the analyses overnight and return to
 investigation the next day. Below we describe each of the analyses and 
how Jigsaw presents it.</p>

                        <h4>Document Summarization</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">Document summarization 
is integrated in different ways in Jigsaw. The Document View shows a 
word cloud (at the top) of selected documents loaded in the view. The 
word cloud helps you to quickly understand themes and concepts within 
the documents by presenting the most frequent words across the selected 
documents. Jigsaw removes frequent, simple words but does not combine 
words like “make”, “makes”, and “making” (stemming) in order to be able 
to highlight identified entities in the word cloud. The number of words 
shown can be adjusted interactively with the slider above the cloud. 
Additionally, the Document View provides a one sentence summary (most 
significant sentence) of the displayed document. This one sentence 
summary of a document is available in all other Jigsaw views as well. It
 can be displayed through a tooltip wherever a document is presented as a
 symbol or its name. The Document Cluster View also provides keyword 
summaries for the clusters.</p>

                        <h4>Document Similarity</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">In Jigsaw, document 
similarity can be measured relative to complete document text or just to
 the entities connected to a document. These different similarity 
measures are of particular interest for semi-structured document 
collections, such as publications, in which metadata-related entities 
(e.g. authors or conferences) are not mentioned in the actual document 
text. The Document Grid View can provide an overview of all the 
documents’ similarity (compared to a selected document) via the order 
and color of the documents in the grid representation. To do this, click
 on a document to select it and then invoke the right menu and choose 
the command to make it as the basis for similarity.  Then go to the 
upper right and make the order and/or the shading of documents in the 
grid be based on similarity. In all other views, the five most similar 
documents can be retrieved with a right mouse button command on a 
document representation.  Note that we have found that the entity-based 
similarity computation sometimes crashes if some of the documents have a
 small number of (or no) entities.</p>

                        <h4>Document Clustering by Theme or Topics</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw also can group 
similar documents together.  Like the calculation for document 
similarity, document clustering also can be based on either the document
 text or on the entities connected to a document. Computed clusters are 
shown in the Document Cluster View or the Document Grid View. Within the
 Cluster View, there is a chooser for selecting which clustering is to 
be shown in the view. Each cluster is labeled by three words/terms that 
describe some of the main concepts within the cluster. Within the Grid 
View, select the option in the upper left to organize documents within 
the grid by cluster.</p>

                        <h4>Document Sentiment Analysis</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">A document’s sentiment 
is its general tone or mood – is it positive and upbeat or is it 
negative and angry?  Metrics about a document’s sentiment, subjectivity,
 and polarity can be displayed in the Document Grid View. Choose the 
appropriate metric from the menu selections in the upper right.  One 
metric can be represented by the order of the documents, and a second 
metric (or the first metric again) can be encoded by the document color.
 To calculate the sentiment of a document, we use lists of “positive” 
and “negative” words and count the number of occurrences in each 
document.  Jigsaw represents positive documents in blue (more positive 
is indicated by darker blue) and negative documents in red.  You can use
 your own set of words to determine the positive or negative sentiment 
of the document as well.  Within the Tools menu is a command to alter 
the sentiment dictionary.  To do this, you simply create text (.txt) 
files with one word per line.  The command then allows you to either 
replace Jigsaw’s own set of sentiment words with your own or to augment 
Jigsaw’s set of words with yours.  Note that these two sets of words 
need not necessarily be related to sentiment also.  You might, for 
example, create one set of words related to baseball and one set related
 to football and then the sentiment analysis view in the Document Grid 
can show whether a document is more baseball-oriented or 
football-oriented.</p>

                        <h4>Recommending Related Entities for Further Investigation</h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">THIS FEATURE IS 
CURRENTLY BROKEN. Jigsaw provides another type of analysis within the 
Graph View. You can select multiple entities (via click then 
control-click) and then press the right mouse button to get the context 
menu and choose the command Recommend Related.  Jigsaw will search for 
entities that are within two document jumps of all of the selected 
entities and will generate a window showing all those entities. You can 
click on any related entity in that view and the path to it from each of
 the selected items is shown in the bottom region.  In that region, you 
can right-click on a path and issue the Show command and then that path 
(documents and entities) will be drawn in the Graph Views visible at 
that time.</p>

                        <h3 id="gathering-evidence">5.5 Gathering Evidence with the Tablet</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw provides a window
 called the Tablet that can help an investigator organize his or her 
thoughts, take notes, gather evidence, develop hypotheses, and so on.  
Below is a picture of the Tablet with some simple information inside.</p>
                        
                        <img src="Jigsaw%20Documentation_files/tablet_view.png" alt="Tablet View" class="img-responsive">
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">An analyst can add 
entities and documents to the Tablet through right-menu commands in the 
other system views.  Simply perform a right mouse menu click on an item 
and then choose the “Add to Tablet” operation.  Entities are shown as 
small circles in their appropriate entity type color and documents are 
small rectangles.  Notes (in pastel yellow) can be attached to entities 
and documents in the Tablet via a right menu command, or notes can 
simply be placed anywhere in the window by clicking and typing. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The analyst can 
manipulate objects in the Tablet via the usual Cut (ctrl-x or cmd-x), 
Copy (ctrl-c or cmd-c), Paste (ctrl-v or cmd-v), and Delete (delete key)
 commands.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Connect command allows you to connect any two items with a line.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Tablet also supports
 the creation of timelines (an example is shown toward the bottom here).
  To do so, select the Create Timeline operation at the top then click 
down in the window to start one endpoint of the timeline and drag to a 
position for the other endpoint and then release the mouse button. 
Events can be explicitly added to the timeline (right mouse click on the
 timeline and choose the Add Event operation), or other items in the 
window can be connected to the timeline (just drag and drop the item 
onto the timeline).</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Additionally, bookmarks 
of Jigsaw views can be added to the Tablet window.  Here, you see a 
Document View bookmark to the lower left and a List View bookmark to the
 right.  You can add a view bookmark by invoking the “Add as Bookmark to
 Tablet” command from the Bookmark menu in any view.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The final operation at 
the top, Add Page, allows you to add new pages/tabs to the Tablet for 
your analysis. Below is shown a Tablet with multiple pages, two of which
 are illustrated.  The first shows how you can construct a social 
network-style diagram from your analysis and the second shows a 
timeline-focused analysis display.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Tablet contains a command for exporting the current tab to a PNG image file.</p>

                        <h3>Jigsaw Datafile Format</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">Jigsaw Datafiles (with 
suffix .jig) are xml files that encapsulate a set of one or more 
documents.  Presently, for each document the file contains the document 
ID, its date, any other documents it references, the document’s source, 
and the actual text contents of the document, along with any entities 
that have been identified in the document.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">A Jigsaw Datafile contains an outermost <code>&lt;documents&gt;</code> tag that encloses multiple <code>&lt;document&gt;</code> items.  Each <code>&lt;document&gt;</code> should contain a <code>&lt;docId&gt;</code> and it has an optional <code>&lt;docDate&gt;</code> and other reference fields.  The plain text source/contents of the document should be in the <code>&lt;docText&gt;</code> field and the identified entity values such as <code>&lt;date&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;money&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;place&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;organization&gt;</code> trail.  Note that you can add other entity types into that section as well.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">There are some rules to 
follow for entity types, values, and other text in Project files.  
Entity types cannot have spaces in them.  Entity values and the report 
description text cannot contain the &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, and % characters 
as they are illegal in xml contents.  To put those characters into text 
regions, use the following abbreviations.</p>
                        
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
                            <li>&amp; - &amp;amp;</li>
                            <li>&gt; - &amp;gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt; - &amp;lt;</li>
                            <li>% - &amp;#37;</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">The first line of a .jig
 file can specify the file type, for example, Unicode, in the manner 
that is typically done for xml files.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">An example of a Jigsaw Datafile with one document in it is shown below.  Look in the datafiles folder for other larger examples.</p>

In the first action of its kind this winter, 18 bison were captured outside Yellowstone National Park on Tuesday and were being tested for brucellosis. Those that have signs of the disease will be sent to slaughter and the rest will be marked and set free, according to Karen Cooper, a spokeswoman for the Montana Department of Livestock. 
The bison, a mix of calves, yearlings and adults, were hazed into a pen just before noon Tuesday near Horse Butte, west of Yellowstone. The bison were then loaded onto trailers and trucked to another holding pen to be tested for brucellosis. 
Cooper said some of the bison had been hazed back into the park on Jan. 28, Feb. 5 and Feb. 13. "These were some of the same animals. We could not get them back in the park so today it was a capture operation," Cooper said. 
Several agencies participated in the capture, including the Department of Livestock, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service. Through a state and federal bison management plan, government agents haze and sometimes capture bison that leave Yellowstone. The plan is intended to reduce the risk that bison will transmit brucellosis to cattle in the area.
